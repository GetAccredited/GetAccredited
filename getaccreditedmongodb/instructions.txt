Instructions to enter the data into mongodb.

1) Create a folder in the data folder you created called backup.
    For example mine is: C:\data\backup
   Note: You can skip this step if you want to, and just use the existing backup folder
   in GetAccredited/getaccreditedmongodb/getaccredited

2) Move the getaccredited folder into the backup folder.
   Note: You can skip this step if you want to, and just use the existing backup folder
   in GetAccredited/getaccreditedmongodb/getaccredited

3) Go to the bin where the mongodb executables are in terminal/command prompt
   Note: On a Mac/Linux, you don't have to do this step. You can run mongorestore from anywhere.
	ex: "cd c:\Program Files\MongoDB 2.6 Standard\bin"

4) Call the mongorestore function with the name of the database and the folder where the backup is.
   mongorestore --db [database_name] [backup_folder]
	ex: "mongorestore --db getaccredited /data/backup/getaccredited"

5)To test that it worked, go into the mongo shell and say
	"use getaccredited" then "show collections"

6) There should be collections like users, and formdata.
